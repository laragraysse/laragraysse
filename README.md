<h4> ABOUT ME 🙋🏽‍♀️👩🏽‍💻 </h4>
<p> 
  Hey there, I'm Lara and I'm a 21yo mom who's addicted to learning 📚, eating 🍣 and playing games 🖱.
  <br>
  I fell in love with web development and design back in 2019 while I was studying it in my professional IT course in high school. Time has passed and I decided to take this topic seriously. I'm studying everyday and taking jobs as a freelancer not only to acquire experience but also because as a freelancer I have the opportunity to develop my sense of responsibility and my maturity, plus I have enough freedom to work the way I like.
